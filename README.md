# Workspaces

Chrome plugin to aid users with bookmark groups. The idea is to be able to
define different workspaces by saving current window tabs as a group.

## Installation

Right now you need to download the git project to a folder and load that folder
as a Chrome extension. You'll need to activate Chrome's developer mode in
the extensions tab.

## Usage

Click on the blue icon next to the omnibox, write a name for the workspace and hit
enter. That's it!

To open a workspace click on the workspaces menu (blue icon next to the omnibox) and
click on the workspace.

## Development

* `git clone` this repository
* Make the changes you want
* Open a pull request

## License
